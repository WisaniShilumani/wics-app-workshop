# Women in Computer Science - App Workshop

## Build a mobile app! 🎉

Welcome to the repo for the WICS App workshop. This doccie will help you get prepared for the workshop and get the most out of it. Please work through the steps below and make sure to have a working system before the workshop starts. **It should only take 10 minutes** (depending on your internet speed). If you have any questions please mail them to wshilumani@gmail.com or ask me on the Slack Channel.

## Step 1 - Install Node and NPM (Node Package Manager)

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. NPM is Node's package manager, that makes it easy to share and reuse JavaScript code.

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and install Node for your Operating System.
2. Run `node -v` from your command line tool or terminal to ensure that Node installed
3. Run `npm -v` to ensure that NPM has installed

## Step 2 - Install Expo CLI

Expo is an open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.

The Expo CLI is a command line interface that interfaces between you and the Expo tools.

1. Run `npm install --global expo-cli`
2. Run `expo -V` to verify that expo has been installed (note the caps "-V" this time)

## Step 3 - Create your first Expo App! 🎉

1. Open your terminal in a directory of your choosing
2. Run `expo init my-app`, replacing "my-app" with a name of your choice
3. Run `cd my-app` once the initialization is complete
4. Run `expo start` to start the app server, you should see a QR code in the terminal, or in an automatically opened up browser tab.
